# Notification of Blog Migration
I'll migrate the blog to [Mao's Blog]("https://mao-blog-7hgbz9fqv-mao718.vercel.app/"). There are two main reasons for it.   
1. Scalability: The new place was created by [Lee Sang Min]("https://github.com/morethanmin") which contains the search engine.  
2. Better visualization: Since I'm bad at setting up the front end the pages look mostly boring and messy. The new place provides the format for me. I believe it will enhance the reader's reading experience.

Master student wants to share and discuss deep learning idea.

This blog will mainly share the things I'm interested in. Maybe the summary of the paper, learning record, or code implementation.  
If there are any errors please let me know.
